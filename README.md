### About the Library
The leccore is designed for the rapid development of modern, efficient and easy to maintain C++ applications.
It is part of the [liblec libraries](https://github.com/alecmus/liblec). It is built to contain the most
fundamental building blocks like databases, file management, registry settings, and other general helper utilities
specially designed to make building robust, sophisticated applications a breeze. Furthermore, it is designed to
bind together all the other liblec libraries like [lecui](https://github.com/alecmus/lecui) and
[lecnet](https://github.com/alecmus/lecnet).
